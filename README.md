# Employee_-productivity-Analysis
This analytical study investigates the dynamics of employee performance within an organizational context, leveraging the employee_productivity_dataset(1).csv to explore key workplace variables. The analyses encompass a series of statistical tests and visualizations to address four primary objectives: (1) assessing correlations between Weekly_Hours and Stress_Level, Stress_Level and Productivity_Score, and Remote_Work (%) and Satisfaction_Score; (2) evaluating gender-based differences in Productivity_Score and Stress_Level through independent t-tests; (3) examining departmental variations in mean Productivity_Score via one-way ANOVA; and (4) visualizing data distributions and relationships through histograms, scatter plots, bar charts, and violin plots. These analyses aim to elucidate the factors influencing employee productivity, stress, and satisfaction, providing data-driven insights to inform organizational strategies. By employing rigorous statistical methods and visualizations, this study seeks to uncover patterns and relationships that enhance understanding of workplace dynamics and guide evidence-based decision-making.
